    <p>Yii is a high performance, component-based PHP framework for rapidly developing modern Web applications.
        The name Yii (pronounced <code>Yee</code> or <code>[ji:]</code>) means "simple and evolutionary" in Chinese. It can also
        be thought of as an acronym for <strong>Yes It Is</strong>!</p>
    <h2>What is Yii Best for? <span id="what-is-yii-best-for"></span><a href="#what-is-yii-best-for" class="hashlink">¶</a></h2><p>Yii is a generic Web programming framework, meaning that it can be used for developing all kinds
        of Web applications using PHP. Because of its component-based architecture and sophisticated caching
        support, it is especially suitable for developing large-scale applications such as portals, forums, content
        management systems (CMS), e-commerce projects, RESTful Web services, and so on.</p>
    <h2>How does Yii Compare with Other Frameworks? <span id="how-does-yii-compare-with-other-frameworks"></span><a href="#how-does-yii-compare-with-other-frameworks" class="hashlink">¶</a></h2><p>If you're already familiar with another framework, you may appreciate knowing how Yii compares:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Like most PHP frameworks, Yii implements the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and promotes code
            organization based on that pattern.</li>
        <li>Yii takes the philosophy that code should be written in a simple yet elegant way. Yii will never try to
            over-design things mainly for the purpose of strictly following some design pattern.</li>
        <li>Yii is a full-stack framework providing many proven and ready-to-use features: query builders
            and ActiveRecord for both relational and NoSQL databases; RESTful API development support; multi-tier
            caching support; and more.</li>
        <li>Yii is extremely extensible. You can customize or replace nearly every piece of the core's code. You can also
            take advantage of Yii's solid extension architecture to use or develop redistributable extensions.</li>
        <li>High performance is always a primary goal of Yii.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yii is not a one-man show, it is backed up by a <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/about/">strong core developer team</a>, as well as a large community
        of professionals constantly contributing to Yii's development. The Yii developer team
        keeps a close eye on the latest Web development trends and on the best practices and features
        found in other frameworks and projects. The most relevant best practices and features found elsewhere are regularly incorporated into the core framework and exposed
        via simple and elegant interfaces.</p>
    <h2>Yii Versions <span id="yii-versions"></span><a href="#yii-versions" class="hashlink">¶</a></h2><p>Yii currently has two major versions available: 1.1 and 2.0. Version 1.1 is the old generation and is now in maintenance mode. Version 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Yii, adopting the latest
        technologies and protocols, including Composer, PSR, namespaces, traits, and so forth. Version 2.0 represents the current
        generation of the framework and will receive the main development efforts over the next few years.
        This guide is mainly about version 2.0.</p>
    <h2>Requirements and Prerequisites <span id="requirements-and-prerequisites"></span><a href="#requirements-and-prerequisites" class="hashlink">¶</a></h2><p>Yii 2.0 requires PHP 5.4.0 or above. You can find more detailed requirements for individual features
        by running the requirement checker included in every Yii release.</p>
    <p>Using Yii requires basic knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), as Yii is a pure OOP-based framework.
        Yii 2.0 also makes use of the latest features of PHP, such as <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php">namespaces</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.traits.php">traits</a>. Understanding these concepts will help
        you more easily pick up Yii 2.0.</p>
